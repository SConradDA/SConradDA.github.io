About me

I’m an operations-focused data professional transitioning into data analytics, with experience in performance tracking, KPI reporting, and process improvement. I enjoy turning complex operational data into clear, actionable insights that help teams understand what’s happening and where to focus next.

My role is to help teams make better decisions by building reliable reports, dashboards, and performance views that are accurate, easy to understand, and useful in real-world operations. I focus on making data practical and accessible, not just visually appealing. My goal is to communicate insights clearly and support smarter, data-driven decision-making across the organization.
